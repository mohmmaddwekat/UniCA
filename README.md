# Prerequisites
PHP and Composer should be installed:
This is how to install it if you're using Windows:
```
php composer-setup.php --install-dir=bin --filename=composer
```

# How To Use
To clone and run this application, follow the follwing instructions:
* Clone the project from this GitHub repository
* Download the project through this command of Laravel Composer
```
composer create-project laravel/laravel project
```
* Now, create a new folder in the laravel project you have just created, namely, vendor. And take the content of this folder from the project repo. Then, create a file named .env and also paste the content of this file from the project repo.
* Then you need to create a new database. Put the connection details (host, username, password) in the .env file you have already created.
* Now, you need to install the Fortify, and laravel-to-uml packages using these commands:
 ```
composer require laravel/fortify
composer require andyabih/laravel-to-uml --dev
```

     
* Now, in order to let the reset password feature to run, create an account on Mailtrap, select the Laravel environment, go to .env file and paste the instructions from Mailtrap in there. Do not forget to pass any dummy email in the MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS. eg, team@test.com
* Finally, to run the project in your IDE:
 ```
php artisan migrate
php artisan db:seed
php artisan serve
```
Now you are ready to go and enjoy UniCA on your browser :)!

# Implementation
#### Laravel is based on MVC (Model View Controller) Design Pattern. We have also used two other design patterns:
#### The first one, is, factory design pattern. We use this design pattern in importing a database, exporting, and the version control. This will increase the system scalability, in case a new type of files is required to be added. The factory design pattern allows us to handle any other types of files without the need of editing on the source code.
#### The second design pattern we have used, is, singleton. We have implemented it in the connection profile. Singleton design pattern allows the client to create only one instance, and so this will prevent different types of users to edit on the same file program at the same time.

### Below is the logic of our work:

#### 1. Adding a new universities
#### A controller was created to add a new university by the super admin.


#### 2. Add department head
#### The department head can be added by the university to each of the departments within the college. 




#### 3. Add the Dean of the College
#### A dean can be added to each college by the university

#### 4. Add Students
#### Students can be added by the department head by importing an excel file.


#### 5. Send Request
#### A student can send a request to withdraw materials or download materials to the head of the department and then the department head will transfer them to the dean if necessary. 



#### 6. Add a new role with permissions
#### Using the models, we were able to apply a many-to-many relationship between the roles and permissions. Using the seeder feature, we were able to define all users permissions that would be in the system.
#### In the same seeder, we were also able to define the main four roles in our system: Super-Admin, Admin, Staff, and Reader. We assigned the permissions for each role. 
#### In the Role Controller, we have handled the edit-permission functionality.
